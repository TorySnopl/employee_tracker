## What I Learned
This was a fun project to combine inquirer and MYSQL in order to make the information in the database more accessible. It really helped solidify how useful inquirer can be. Although simple, this app has real world application. It was initally a challenge to figure out the syntax to use the input from the inquirer in the db.query statements.

I really like discovering new npms to use like cfonts. It was so easy to use, and took away the challenge of creating anscii art for the logo graphic. 

I continue to learn new Javascript commands too. I initially thought that formatting the JSON into tables in the CLI would be more labor intensive. however just using console.table instead of console.log took care of that. 

Overall, I think I would really like to work with databases and MYSQL in the future.
